create a 3d helpers module that has:
    angular distance between two eulers
    generating SO(3)

questions for linda or else:
    when generating the null dataset should I match number of views to the number of samples in our experimental data for more normalized comparison?
    or should I just divide by number of views for a norm on each component?

    is using the fibbonaci spiral method with quaternions the best method for generating these views? does it account for each planar view?
    
    how should rendering be done? do edges matter that are on the interior of the object? should we use the matlab builtin or go with a more complex convolutional method?

    generate a "table" distrobution that takes gravity into account to compare the experimental and null distrobution to
